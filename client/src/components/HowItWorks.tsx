                The more you select, the narrower the universe of results. Don’t
                click anything and you’ll search the entire country. Click the
                Southwest and the Northwest and you’ll narrow it down to only
                towns in those two regions. The same goes with Politics and
                Types of Living.

                Don’t have a budget for your house yet? Leave the Home Budget
                blank and it won’t affect the search. Fill it in and depending
                on if you select 2/3 or 4/5 rooms, RELO will only show towns
                that have an average home price near your budget. For example a
                result with “2/3 - 4/5 Bed Avg: $447k - $856k” means that town’s
                2 to 3 bedroom homes cost $447k on average and its 4 to 5
                bedroom homes cost $856k on average.
